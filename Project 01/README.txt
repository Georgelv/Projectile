1. TTY Game (Projectile) Description: 

As the player, if you press "run" the program, the program will first generate a "Welcome" page. Following the Welcome Page is the instruction. The program will generate a virtual projectile and wall for the user and the user can follow the instruction to input the speed and angle of the projectile. The distance and height of the wall will be generated randomly from 1 to 50 meters and 1 to 30 meters. The computer program will examine if the projectile cross the wall or not based on the Physics equation. Besides, there will be score track for each player. If the user wants to continue the game at the end of the round, the user can input "again". Meanwhile, the user can input "quit" to quit the game.

2. Score policy

The score is initialized to 0. After each launch, the score will be "-1". A close cross will get 5 points (4 net points); A far cross will get 3 points (2 net). A close miss will not change the score (-1 net); A far miss will lose 2 points (-3 points net). The program will show score after each launch and at the end of each round.

3. Extra Credit

I add some randomness output for this program. After each launch, the computer will generate different outputs based on the result each user has. (Follow the first question of the "Extra Credit".)
